### 2024 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

I've come up with a few different concepts and I'm still not sure this is the direction I want to go in. My idea is to have falling blocks that stack into towers at the bottom of the screen. As this is happening the screen will scroll up slowly, deleting the bottom row and preventing too much buildup. I was thinking that if blocks of the same shape make a line of 3 they will also be deleted. Along with this I would have trails, particle effects and background effects to elevate it.
